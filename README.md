# The X-files problem

## This problem is to show abilities in data loading, cleaning and descriptive analysis. 

You’re at the airport, on your way to a Data Science conference abroad. A strange, but somewhat familiar man sits right next to you. He’s talking on the phone and wearing a tin hat. He briefly looks at you and turns away lowering his voice suspiciously. Although you know it isn’t right, you try to listen in on the conversation he’s having---let’s call it your scientific interest.

- Strange Man: “... not a real one, no,” he says. “Do you know how rare U.F.O. sightings are?”
  
- You: “Actually,” you interject, “it’s really simple, if you have the data.”
  
- The old man looks at you, first alarmed and then with curiosity.

- Strange Man: “Explain.”

- You: “Well, with enough data you can make estimations about the probability of an event, however rare it may occur.”

- Strange Man: “Can you do it?” he asks you.

- You: “Of course, I’m a data scientist. I just need data.”

- Strange Man: “In that case,” as the man spoke, he began rummaging through his travel bag until he pulled out a parcel covered in tinfoil. It was a shoebox filled with floppy disks.

- Strange Man: “...here’s data my company, Infinito, has collected about U.F.O. sightings. People from around the world go to my company’s website and fill-out a form about their U.F.O. experience. I would like to hire you to tell me where I should go if I want to see an U.F.O. or interview people that claim sightings.”

- As you take the box, still wondering where you’ll get a computer capable of reading the floppy disks, he gets up and starts to leave.

- Strange Man: “Ohhhh!  I almost forgot.” he says. “Make sure you present your findings in a way my shareholders will understand. The truth may be out there... and no one is doing anything.”
